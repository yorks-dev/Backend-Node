Javascript does implicit type conversion -> corecion

Abstract operations are not a part of the ECMAScript language; they are defined here solely to aid the specification of the semantics of the ECMAScript language.

1. Type Conversion
The ECMAScript language implicitly performs automatic type conversion as needed. To clarify the semantics of certain constructs it is useful to define a set of conversion abstract operations. The conversion abstract operations are polymorphic; they can accept a value of any ECMAScript language type. But no other specification types are used with these operations.

SIMPLY - We cant use abstract opetaion , but they get used internally.
